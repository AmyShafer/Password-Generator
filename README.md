# Password Generator

This is a Password Generator. It creates a unique and secure password based on a user's inputs.

This project was built upon from existing code. The present HTML and CSS code is nearly-identical to the code originally provided. Colors and font-families have changed but sizing and positioning were untouched.

Some JavaScript was given at the start of the project. Over 50 lines of original code were added.

## Future-improvements

This application can be improved by offering the user a checkbox input instead of prompt. JavaScript's prompt display has several drawbacks. From the user's point of view, they may not realize they entered a typo. Think of all the times you were sure your typed you password correctly! 

For learning purposes, prompt fit in well with this lesson. I look forward to personalizing this project with my own design ideas. I will have more examples to draw inspiration from as the class dives deeper into practical event options.
