# Password Generator

This is a Password Generator. It creates a unique and secure password based on a user's inputs.

This project was built upon from existing code. The present HTML and CSS code is nearly-identical to the code originally provided. Colors and font-families have changed but sizing and positioning were untouched.

Some JavaScript was given at the start of the project. Over 80 lines of original code were added.

## Future-improvements

The application's randomizer could be more...random. Even the the different characters types are random, the types are clustered. In another words, typically all the lowercase letters seems to be together, all the uppercase together, and so on.

Presently, the applications validation testing is not fully functional. For instance, even though the application is able to test is the user enter a valid password length, the new password length is not update.

Similarly, even though the application is able to test whether or not the user did not enter any of the needed character selections, the code that follows is broken.
